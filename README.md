# Oversteer - Steering Wheel Manager for Linux

https://github.com/berarma/oversteer

Graphical application to configure Logitech Wheels.

This software uses the Linux driver for Logitech HID++ devices and thus it
could work on any model supported by said driver.

It's only been tested on the Logitech G29 Driving Force. It could work on other
models but it has been untested.

Please, use at your own risk. Suggestions, bugs and pull requests welcome.

## Installation

For now, it lacks a convenient installation method.

Download this repository and run ```./oversteer.py```.

```gksudo``` is required and used when only root has permissions to configure the device.

```jstest-gtk``` is launched when the test button is clicked.
